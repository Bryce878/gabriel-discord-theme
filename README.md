# Gabriel Discord Theme

Just made this because it sounded fun.

Template I used can be found at https://bdeditor.dev/

If you know how to download plugins/themes with BD (BetterDiscord) than great!

If not, Let me teach you.

With BD installed go to user settings, scroll down on the bar that is on the LEFT in settings, stop when you see "Themes", click open theme folder, drag the downloaded theme from your web browser into the folder, then you should be done!
